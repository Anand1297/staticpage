 Rishabh Pant Blocks Suresh Raina's Way, Fans Say "Don't Try This With MS Dhoni"
		</div>
		<hr>
		<div class="news_content">
			Rishabh Pant has already made a name for himself as a prankster, apart from having cemented his reputation as one of the most explosive batsmen of current times. In the Indian Premier League (IPL) match between Delhi Capitals (DC) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) on Wednesday, Pant's antics were on display again â€“ Suresh Raina being at the receiving end. As TV cameras turned back on the pitch after a break between overs, Raina was seen struggling to make his way back to the crease, his way being blocked by Pant's not-so-huge frame.

Mumbai Indians - Five Players To Watch Out For
		</div>
		<hr>
		<div class="news_content">
			Mumbai Indians, the three-time Indian Premier League (IPL) champions, had a forgettable outing in 2018 as they failed to qualify for the playoffs despite having a strong squad. They managed to win just six out of 14 matches they played in IPL 2018. It was only the second time in the last nine seasons, the Mumbai Indians failed to qualify for the playoffs.

             In spite of their lackadaisical performance last year, the franchise led by Rohit Sharma are one of the most successful teams in the tournament.

             2013, 2015, 2017 winners have made recovering from bad starts a habit.

            Mumbai Indians, eyeing their fourth IPL title, will be one of the favorites to win in 2019 as their squad looks well balanced, with a good mix of experience and youth.
